# HAZBIN HOTEL

*Hazbin Hotel* is a series about the princess of hell ***Charlie Morningstar***, Daughter of ***Lucifer Morningstar***, who wishes to stop heaven from coming down to hell and exterminating a bunch of its citizens as a solution for overpopulation. In her attempt, she is currently managing a hotel called the *Hazbin Hotel* where she attempts to "rehabilitate" demons in order for them to get redemption and fly up to heaven. But to no surprise, everyone thinks that this is a stupid idea. She still has the support from all of his friends including:

1. ***Vaggie*** - A fallen angel who later became charlie's girlfriend and is a co-manager at the hotel.
2. ***Angel Dust*** - Hell's famous p*rnstar who was forced to become a resident for free just to get the hotel a reputation. 
3. ***Alastor*** - A powerful Overlord who is willing to help run the hotel in the expense of his own entertainment when the whole operation falls down into chaos.
4. ***Nifty*** - The hotel's personal cute and creepy maid who keeps the hotel clean for everyone out of her own enjoyment and hatred for dirty places and bugs.
5. ***Husk*** - The hotel's bartender who is an ex-overlord who lost his life from gambling with more powerful overlords and sold his soul to Alastor.
